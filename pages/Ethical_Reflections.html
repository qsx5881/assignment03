          In this fast-paced world of technology, consumers are literally baffled at the myriad high-tech gadgets that have captured the market. Be it smartphones, laptops or e-hairbrushes, the range is mind boggling. While the glitz and glitter of this volatile tech age allures customers, its aftermath is worth reflecting upon ethically. As responsible global citizens, it is essential to assess the ethics pertaining to technology and come up with solutions to problems synonymous to it.<br><br>

          As an individual, when I recount the ethical issues in technology, I vehemently favour the Right to Repair concept.  More so, because nowadays the market trend is of e gadgets. Right from a simple toothbrush or mundane cookware to smart luggage, everything has an electronic component in it. So, when these e devices get damaged, they are conveniently discarded if they can’t be repaired. As a result, endless e waste is generated. In fact, the 2017 survey unveiled the fact that in New Zealand, 20.1kg of e waste is accumulated per person every year! So, it’s advisable to fix e-stuff rather than dumping them to landfill.<br><br>

          Even though the Right to Repair is still a debatable issue, I would suggest it’s legislation internationally with country specific clauses to cater to the needs of every nation. It’s not very difficult to fix e -gadgets after all in spite of the repairability versus efficiency wrangle. Consumers are scared to repair e- stuff as manufacturers charge a heavy price. With that amount of money or probably less, a new device can be purchased, hassle free. Moreover, a damaged gadget has to be shipped (sometimes to international destinations) much to the inconvenience of the owner who is left without his device for an indefinite period of time. Needless to mention, rural or highly dispersed areas suffer the unavailability of first party repair shops.<br><br>

          To solve the problem, I recommend setting up third party repair shops run by entrepreneurs both in urban and remote areas.  In this way, shop owners would run a steady business, repairs would be pocket friendly to consumers and time saving too. Besides, the Right to Repair would generate local jobs for technicians in these electronic repair outlets. Undoubtedly, the foremost ethical responsibility is to prevent our planet from becoming a victim of e-waste landfills. So as per my conviction, fixing gadgets and retuning them to their owners would reduce e-waste and minimise landfills.<br><br>
          
          To conclude, the concept of the Right to Repair definitely goes hand in hand with technology, sustainable development and is a potently ethical step towards the healthy future of Mother Earth.

          The right to repair means allowing end users and consumers to repair appliances they bought without any restrictions from manufacturer. Manufacturers should release repair related manuals, software, and spare parts for public usage. Customers can also choose aftermarket parts for their own devices.<br><br>
          
          In summary, the right-to-repair can be benefit to people living in places where it is hard to find authorized repair shops, it can also create new opportunities for local companies to provide third-party maintenance and repair jobs. Thus, people can get their appliances repaired fast instead of waiting a long time for authorized people to fix it. Sometime right-to-repair may even allow customers themselves to update their appliances to fix bugs in appliances’ firmware instead of asking customers to take their appliances to get update done at service center. This can reduce carbon emission as customers do not need to drive to the service center. All the above will help to extend the lifetime of devices people have and reduce e-waste and carbon emission which is good for our environment and health.<br><br>
          
          On the other hand, manufacturers worry that the right-to-repair could put consumer’s safety and privacy in danger, jeopardize manufacturer’s reputation and intellectual property right. In order to protect companies’ interest, it is a good idea to provide spare parts to only certified suppliers. People who are against the right-to-repair argue that manufacturers must design their product with complex technology to compete with other manufacturers. Complexity will result in high efficiency and increasing difficulty to repair. Thus, to ensure efficiency of devices, it is best to get device repaired by authorized worker.<br><br>
          
          My personal recommendation is for the right-to-repair. I think there is some moderate way to make both sides happy. Manufacturer can provide training sources for independent repair shops; they can get manufacturers’ technical and parts support if they have passed manufacturers’ test. With the help of the internet and 5g, even people living in rural areas can get their qualification. As for quality controls, automotive industries have already shown us how things can be done. It is common sense that once your car is serviced or repaired by an independent repair shop, it is their responsibility to provide a warranty for the car they fixed. The responsibility transferred from manufacturer to independent workshop once they start to take over customers’ cars.<br><br>

          There are two important ethical issues about right-to-repair:<br><br>
          <ol>
            <li>The most important ethical issue is that customers’ important private information may be stolen by the person who repairs or maintains customers’ devices. That information may be used for illegal activities. Nowadays, most repair jobs need to be done with the help of computer technologies, so people who repair customers’ appliances should follow ACM code according to ACM definition. Thus, technicians who steal customers’ private information violate ACM code 1.6 Respect privacy. According to ACM code 1.6, we should only use personal information for legitimate ends and without violating the rights of individuals and groups. This violation is very serious. Customers can lose money and reputation. Sometime, like the famous Edison Chen photo scandal, customers’ very private photos can be posted online without permission from customers.</li><br>

            <li>Another ethical issue is people who repair the device may use secondhand parts or aftermarket parts with poor quality, yet they still charge customer for new parts. As for ACM 1.3 Be honest and trustworthy, Honesty is an essential component of trustworthiness. A computing professional should be transparent and provide full disclosure of all pertinent system capabilities, limitations, and potential problems to the appropriate parties. Making deliberately false or misleading claims, fabricating or falsifying data, offering, or accepting bribes, and other dishonest conduct are violations of the Code. Poor quality products can put customer’s device and personal safety at risk.</li>
