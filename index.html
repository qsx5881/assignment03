        <h2>THE RIGHT TO REPAIR SMARTPHONES: AND ITS IMPACT ON ELECTRONIC WASTE AND CONSUMERS</h2>
      </blockquote>
        <p>
          <ul>
            Smartphones are an immensely popular technology that many people have had exposure to. It is now one of the first points of entry to gain access to the Information Technology world. Of these devices, smartphone use is continuing to increase. With 6.56 billion smartphone users in the world in 2022, it accounts for over 83% of the world’s population (O'Dea, 2022).<br><br>
  
            The average lifespan of a smartphone is only one year (Perzanowski, 2022), this is not only a result of hardware failures but also because consumers’ have an insatiable need to “upgrade” to the latest technology. Along with the yearly release schedules of smartphones often with only incremental updates (Baecker, 2019), it contributes to unnecessary and dangerous electronic waste. The manufacture of smartphone requires the use of finite and precious materials, some of which contain chemicals that are hazardous to the environment. Though they should be carefully disposed of, they often end up in landfill (Baecker, 2019). Electronic waste that ends up in landfill can release dangerous chemicals and pollutants, with studies showing that toxicity levels are far higher near landfills and e-waste sites (Panwar & Ahmed, 2018).<br><br>
  
            Manufacturers supporting and contributing to the right to repair is a solution that can help to mitigate the negative environmental impact that the constant replacement cycle has created. However, technology vendors do not tend to support or acknowledge a purchaser's right to repair (Perzanowski, 2022). This increases the cost and complexity to repair a broken smartphone, resulting in consumers’ buying new. Understanding why there is opposition for the right to repair one’s own devices, can help us make a more informed decision when deciding to purchase a new smartphone.

        <h2>WHAT IS RIGHT TO REPAIR</h2>
      </blockquote>
        <p>
          <ul>
            When you purchase a product, you should be allowed to do what you want with it. For example, if something breaks, it’s your right to choose to repair it, you should be able to decide to do it yourself or call a professional. People would also be more likely to choose the repair option if it was simple and cheap. Manufacturers of smartphones tend to be against allowing consumer to make these repairs and make it difficult for individuals or repair services to have access to the replacement part (Rossmann, 2021).<br><br>
  
            This means that when a device is out of warranty you wouldn’t be able choose the cheaper route of going to a local repair shop, instead it would require you to send the product back to the manufacturer. The price of repair from the manufacturer when out of warranty is often very high and takes longer than just purchasing a new replacement. Right to repair makes it so that manufacturers would have to provide documentation of how to repair their devices and make parts more accessible to both consumers and repair shops (Smith, 2021). This then allows for consumers to choose whether to repair rather than manufacturer’s taking that option away.

        <h2>REDUCES ELECTRONIC WASTE:</h2>
      </blockquote>
        <p>
          <ul>
            The average lifespan of a smartphone is only one year (Perzanowski, 2022), this is not only a result of hardware failures but also because consumers’ have an insatiable need to “upgrade” to the latest technology. In 2018, there were 1.5 billion smartphones manufactured worldwide (Perzanowski, 2022). The process to create a smartphone includes the extraction and refining of finite raw materials, manufacturing the product, and then shipping the product around the globe. This entire process contributed to more than 50 million metric tonnes of electronic waste for 2018.<br><br>
    
            As devices become more complex in their designs, they become harder to repair without documentation being provided by manufacturers. Along with this manufacturer’s need to also make replacement parts more easily available so that repairs can be made in a cost effective and timely manner. According to an investigation by Motherboard in 2017, Apple contractually forces recycling partners to shred their old devices (Koebler, 2017), to prevent any parts being reused in any way including repairs.<br><br>
            
            When smartphones break or are replaced with the newest yearly model, often with only incremental updates (Baecker, 2019), the “old” devices become obsolete to the current user. In the US it has been reported that an estimated 150 million devices will go to landfill each year (Proctor, 2018). According to a report by the World Health Organization (World Health Organization, 2009), most electronic waste will end up in some private, small-scale, and informal recycling manufactures in Asia and Africa. Electronic waste has hazardous effects on the environment and people as they contain high levels arsenic, lead, mercury, lithium as well as toxins like brominated flame retardants (Perzanowski, 2022). Over time these chemicals and toxins can contaminate the surrounding soil and seep into the ground water (Ossola, 2014). If the landfills electronic waste resides in also burn solid waste, it releases acrid fumes and pollutants into the air. This has resulted in toxicity levels being far higher near landfills with e-waste (Panwar & Ahmed, 2018).<br><br>
            
            Extending the lifespan of smartphones through repair reduces the raw material use and energy consumption (Ministry for the Environment, 2021) and helps to slow the production of unnecessary electronic waste. A study has shown that just extending the life of electronics in the EU by one year can be equivalent to removing two million cars from the road (Sims, 2021). Right to repair is crucial in disrupting the unsustainable flow of electronic waste. Repairing smartphones to extend their life won’t stop consumer’s from buying the newest devices however, it may keep the devices in use longer and would give an alternative option from throwing it to landfill.

        <h2>BENEFITS CONSUMERS:</h2>
      </blockquote>
        <p>
          <ul>
            When a phone becomes damaged or malfunctions, there are two options that are presented to the consumer, to repair or replace. Using intellectual property law, hardware design, software restrictions, pricing strategies, and marketing messages (Perzanowski, 2022), companies have created the situation for consumers where it would be less hassle and make more financial sense to replace their devices rather than repair them.<br><br>
    
            Repair extends the life span of smartphones and allows them to be reused in the second-hand or refurbished markets. This makes the devices more affordable and makes it more accessible to consumers such as low-income families, charities, schools or overseas such as developing nations (Ministry for the Environment, 2021). These transactions on the second-hand market are beneficial to both the buyers and the sellers. For sellers it provides them an opportunity to recover some of the costs incurred form their investment when purchasing it brand new. For the buyer’s it means that there would be more inventory and options of smartphones to choose from on the market. This would also allow for smartphones that need to be repaired be put up for sale on the used market. This is because if the buyer is confident in their own skills and being able to get the parts easily, they would be able to purchase the device in need of repair at a discounted price.<br><br>
    
            With repair being a viable option second-hand markets would be able to put even more downward pressure on the price of new goods. If prices of new phones climb out of reach for some consumers, they will look on the used market instead. Making sure these phones can be easily repaired helps provide more options for consumers.

        <h2>COMPETITION, DEMAND AND SUPPLY:</h2>
      </blockquote>
        <p>
          <ul>
            It’s a combative world, no ambiguity about it. Each and every business be it small, medium or large in stature vying to grab customers from every nook and corner of the globe. In this cut-throat competition the crux is to lure potential customers and extract an extra buck from them. Every industry has joined the rat race. Practically speaking, it's not an easy task to maintain a steady influx of customers because in that case, the product range should be attractive, functional, pocket-friendly and ultimately be able to promote customer satisfaction (Londono, 2021).<br><br>
    
            Talking about product quality if we delve deep into the matter, we will see that in this high-tech era every product of every other company is unique with a plethora of choices available. We must admit that although any product or service launched by a company should be of great quality, it shouldn’t stay there in the market for a long time otherwise it is not possible for business houses to maintain a huge rate of sales invoicing. That means the products shouldn’t be repairable. Instead, they should exist in the market for a certain time period and vanish after that. A new range of products would be introduced to tempt the customers in the name of new technology, fashion trends and latest tech features. Afterall, it is an ever-changing world where needs of the common man keep on changing and the many choices offered in the market boggles every mind.<br><br>
    
            In a nutshell, the trend has become such that no company wants to jeopardise its future by selling highly durable and long-lasting products. This would only vanquish their sales targets every year because they would not be able to attract new customers and without them no revenue would be generated for them to survive the market for the next few years let alone expansion. This is a smart innovative technology of this volatile tech world (Jalan, 2021).<br><br>
    
            The smart approach in today’s market is to manufacture products which are less repairable.The belief goes that if products are more repairable then they are less efficient. Inevitably, an argument can be voiced pertaining to the right to repair. Manufacturers cannot afford to introduce products inferior to their competitors in the market otherwise the customer base will explode.

        <h2>SAFETY:</h2>
      </blockquote>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <strong>Safety for Manufacturers</strong><br>
            Opponents of the right to repair worry about the manufacturer's intellectual property. The right-to-repair regulations have caused manufacturers to concern about their intellectual property rights. Some companies argue that providing repair information will allow third parties’ to get access to the product's proprietary architecture. This may cause some other companies to produce knock-out product with useful information they get from repair manuals. Manufacturers worry that "unauthorized repairs may infringe patents or trade secrets, expose their intellectual property to theft, and endanger consumers" (Gulserliler et al., 2022). Manufacturers also worry that somebody may duplicate their products using spare parts from market.<br><br>
    
            Trade associations such as the Consumer Technology Association worry that manufacturers’ brand reputation can be damaged due to their products repaired by unqualified technicians. Manufacturers worry third party repair shops may sell their refurbished devices to consumers. They worry those refurbished devices may not be refurbished to manufacturers standard. Or those refurbished devices may be repaired with bad quality parts. Customers who bought those refurbished devices do not know what happened. They only blame the brand of the device they bought. This is not good for manufacturers’ reputation.<br><br>
    
            <strong>Safety for Customers</strong><br>
            Those who support right-to-repair such as securepairs.org believe security through obscurity does not exist. Security through obscurity is a famous way to protect a system or an application. This approach relies on reducing the amount of information about a system or application disclosed to protect systems or application’s safety. (Mercuri, R.T. & Neumann, P.G., 2003). A system which is secure enough will still be safe even if people know how the system works. Publishing repair manuals and spare parts will not lower down an already sound smartphone’s security level. Because right-to-repair regulations allow customers to update firmware themselves to fix bugs or change failed parts quickly. Securepairs arguing right-to-repair regulations can make appliance safer (Matsakis, 2019). For example, John Deere tractors often can be updated only by licensed technicians. Farmers who can't afford to wait have resorted to hacking into their tractors with black-market firmware, a far less safe option than using diagnostic tools John Deere could release itself.  With right-to-repair regulation, farmers can update themselves with their own laptop or desktop at home. This increases their devices’ safety a lot.<br><br>
    
            Those who criticize right-to-repair legislation emphasize the potential safety risks that could come with a mandate of this nature. Although sometimes these may be a little exaggerated, but concerns about potentially dangerous components such as high-energy lithium-ion batteries and the use of unauthorized parts could put both customers and people who carries out repair work at risk are legitimate. With the 2017 infamous Samsung Galaxy Note 7 fiasco exposed, batteries with bad quality could cause users' devices to explode, putting them in grave danger. At the same time, incorrect training or mishandling of these dangerous batteries can pose a similar threat to independent repair shops.<br><br>
    
            Concerns about the potential impact on consumers are not limited to hardware failures or inadequate training but may also raise questions about privacy or network security risks. Some manufacturers worry about allowing consumers to "jailbreak" their devices. jailbreak is the practice of deleting or modifying device software to circumvent its current software related design and limitations. Users often jailbreak their devices to introduce features that are not currently supported by their device's operating system or install applications that are not available in their official app store. However, this practice also increases the chance of being exposed to malware and spyware. In addition, some people worry that users may face potential privacy and security risks, because technicians may be granted access to user’s equipment and hardware, which may expose user’s data. This concern was reflected in the hunter Biden laptop scandal. The device was originally sent out to repair liquid exposure, but the hard disk was copied and handed over to political opponents for public exposure by the man who repaired the computer. The manufacturer claims that the third-party maintenance service lacks the responsibility to prevent such acts and expanding third parties’ access to repair their appliance can increase potential risk to their product.

        <h2>CHOOSING RIGHT TO REPAIR</h2>
      </blockquote>
        <p>
          <ul>
            A survey conducted in 2017, revealed that New Zealand generated 20.1 kg e-waste per person annually. The number of electronic products going for waste disposal is a major threat to the environment.<br><br>
    
            Thus, repairing products instead of dumping them as rubbish minimises landfill waste. Right to repair is therefore an environmnt friendly step and is directly connected to climate issue. This topic has been a debatable point globally. In a nutshell, the right to repair should involve the following aspects:<br><br>
    
            <ol>
              <li>Products should be repaired and modified with specific tools.</li><br>
              <li>Product parts should be available at affordable prices to suit the pocket of an average consumer.</li><br>
              <li>Choosing repairers and repair outlets should be promoted thereby allowing customers to suit their preferences.</li><br>
              <li>Ensuring free and easily accessible product repair manuals, schematics, common tools, and other relevant information.</li>
            </ol><br>
    
            It is quite difficult to predict if a product is repairable or not before purchase. Keeping this in mind, consumer NZ has aptly recognised the importance of product reliability and included durability to its testing parameters (Sims,2021).<br><br>
    
            The right to repair would aid to fight major environmental challenges of climate change and conservation of resources. Already, required amendments of laws have been made to save the country from turning into a dumping yard of e-waste. This is a major step in support of the right to repair.
